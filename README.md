# Haven Companion

**Haven Companion** is an open-source VR project in early development, built with Unity and OpenXR. The goal is to create a cozy virtual space where you can relax and chat with an AI companion powered by OpenAI’s API. The companion will feature voice communication, basic animations, and the ability to move, interact with the environment, and respond to your actions. This is a **work-in-progress**, and we’re excited to invite the community to shape its future!

## Current Status

This project is in its **early stages**. Core features like the VR environment, AI integration, and companion interactions are under active development. Expect updates, bugs, and plenty of opportunities to contribute.

## Planned Features

- **AI Companion**: Voice-based conversations using OpenAI’s API.
- **VR Experience**: Immersive room for relaxation, powered by SteamVR and OpenXR.
